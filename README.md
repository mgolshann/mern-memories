## Introduction
This is a code repository for my full stack project called "Memories". in this project I use React Redux, Node.js, Express & MongoDB. It is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.


## Stay up to date with new projects
run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
